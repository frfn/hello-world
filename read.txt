This a test if I can do multiple letters in a GIT command such as -am (add and commit!!) -- will only work on added files only.

Work branch!

Only do --amend WHEN YOU HAVE NOT PUSHED changes into origin. :) thank you.

this is another test. for using git clean -df.

d = directory
f = file

Untracked files are files that are possibly created, moved or copied into your repo.
Thing is, using clean -df clears all those untracked files and deletes it. :)

modified, is different, that is for staging, then committing.
