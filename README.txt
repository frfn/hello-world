To anyone who wants to read this...

Hi!

Just chuggin' along and getting familiar with GIT commands.
So far, so good. 

Files in here are nothing but, you guessed it, test files to get a sense of how GIT works and its commands!

This is a modification, will be reflected through GIT STATUS, need to stage (git add <filename>) before committing.
